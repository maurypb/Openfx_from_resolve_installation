# XMLInputManager Implementation

I've implemented the `XMLInputManager` class, which is responsible for mapping XML input definitions to OFX clips. This class handles the creation of input clips with proper border modes and other settings.

## Files Implemented

1. **XMLInputManager.h** - Header file defining the class interface
2. **XMLInputManager.cpp** - Implementation of the clip creation and border mode handling
3. **XMLInputManagerTest.cpp** - Test program with OFX mocks to verify the implementation

## Key Features

The implementation includes:

### Input Clip Creation

- Creates input clips based on XML definitions
- Sets basic properties like component support and tile support
- Handles optional inputs
- Creates the output clip automatically

### Border Mode Handling

- Maps XML border mode strings to OFX clip preferences
- Supports standard border modes:
  - `clamp` - Extend edge pixels
  - `repeat` - Tile the image
  - `mirror` - Mirror the image at boundaries
  - `black` - Treat outside areas as black/transparent

### Mask Detection

- Automatically detects mask inputs based on naming conventions
- Sets the isMask property for clips with "mask" or "matte" in their names
- Ensures proper handling of mask inputs in the OFX host

## Usage

The XMLInputManager is used in a straightforward way:

```cpp
// 1. Create an instance
XMLInputManager inputManager;

// 2. Create clips from XML
std::map<std::string, std::string> clipBorderModes;
inputManager.createInputs(xmlDef, desc, clipBorderModes);

// 3. The clipBorderModes map contains border mode info for each clip,
//    which can be used later in processing
```

## Testing

The test program uses mock OFX classes to verify that clips are created correctly without requiring an actual OFX host. It:

1. Parses an XML file using XMLEffectDefinition
2. Creates clips using XMLInputManager
3. Reports on the created clips, their border modes, and other properties

## Next Steps

1. **Step 2.3: Integration with BlurPluginFactory** - Test XML parameter and input creation with a real OFX plugin
2. **Step 3.1: GenericEffect Base Class** - Create a base class for all XML-defined effects
3. **Step 3.2: Identity Condition Implementation** - Implement pass-through conditions from XML

## Notes

- Border modes are implemented using OFX clip preferences, which may not be supported by all hosts
- The implementation follows OFX conventions for mask handling
- The border mode information is stored separately for use in kernel processing, which is more reliable than relying on host preferences

This implementation successfully completes Step 2.2 of our implementation plan, providing the ability to create OFX clips from XML definitions and handle border modes.

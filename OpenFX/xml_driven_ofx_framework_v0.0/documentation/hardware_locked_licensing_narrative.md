# Hardware-Locked Licensing with Web Integration
## Technical Narrative and Implementation Strategy

### Executive Summary

This document outlines a hardware-locked licensing system with web-based license management for OFX plugins generated by the XML-driven framework. The approach balances security, user convenience, and development simplicity by combining local license validation with web-based user interfaces for license management and support.

### Business Context

**Target Market**: Professional video editors and colorists using DaVinci Resolve and other OFX-compatible hosts
**Revenue Model**: Low-cost annual licenses ($10-30/year) with hardware locking to prevent casual sharing
**Scale Target**: Up to 50,000 users across multiple plugin products
**Support Philosophy**: Self-service user experience with minimal vendor intervention

### Core Licensing Philosophy

The system is built on the principle that **licensing should enhance the user experience rather than obstruct it**. By embedding license management tools directly into the plugin UI and connecting to web-based resources, users can manage their licenses, access tutorials, and get support without leaving their familiar editing environment.

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Hardware Fingerprinting Foundation

**Cross-Platform Machine Identity Generation**:
Hardware fingerprinting requires platform-specific implementations due to different operating system APIs and hardware access methods:

**Windows Implementation**:
- WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) for hardware queries
- Registry access for system identifiers
- Motherboard serial numbers via `wmic csproduct get uuid`
- CPU information through Windows API calls

**macOS Implementation**:
- IOKit framework for hardware enumeration
- System profiler data through `ioreg` commands
- Hardware UUID via `ioreg -rd1 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice`
- Platform-specific motherboard identifiers

**Linux Implementation**:
- `/proc/cpuinfo` and `/sys/class/dmi/` filesystem access
- `dmidecode` utility for hardware information
- System UUID via `sudo dmidecode -s system-uuid`
- Network interface enumeration through `/sys/class/net/`

**Unified Fingerprint Strategy**:
The fingerprint algorithm combines available identifiers from each platform into a consistent hash, with fallback mechanisms when certain hardware identifiers are unavailable due to permissions or hardware limitations.

**License Binding Process**:
License files contain the authorized machine fingerprint along with product identification, purchase date, and expiration information. The plugin validates the current machine's fingerprint against the licensed fingerprint on every startup, caching the validation result for performance during the session.

### XML-Driven UI Integration

**Enhanced XML Schema**:
The XML effect definition schema is extended to include user interface elements for license management and user support:

```xml
<effect name="PremiumBlur" category="Filter">
    <!-- Standard effect definition -->
    <parameters>
        <!-- Effect parameters -->
    </parameters>
    
    <!-- New licensing and support UI -->
    <user_interface>
        <group name="License Management">
            <web_button name="checkLicense" 
                       label="Check License Status" 
                       url="https://yoursite.com/license/status?product={PRODUCT_ID}&machine={MACHINE_ID}"
                       hint="View license expiration and renewal options" />
                       
            <web_button name="renewLicense" 
                       label="Renew License" 
                       url="https://yoursite.com/license/renew?product={PRODUCT_ID}&machine={MACHINE_ID}"
                       hint="Purchase license renewal" />
                       
            <web_button name="transferLicense" 
                       label="Transfer License" 
                       url="https://yoursite.com/license/transfer?product={PRODUCT_ID}&machine={MACHINE_ID}"
                       hint="Move license to another machine" />
        </group>
        
        <group name="Support & Learning">
            <web_button name="tutorials" 
                       label="Video Tutorials" 
                       url="https://yoursite.com/tutorials/{PRODUCT_NAME}"
                       hint="Learn advanced techniques" />
                       
            <web_button name="support" 
                       label="Get Support" 
                       url="https://yoursite.com/support?product={PRODUCT_ID}&machine={MACHINE_ID}"
                       hint="Contact support with pre-filled information" />
                       
            <web_button name="documentation" 
                       label="User Manual" 
                       url="https://yoursite.com/docs/{PRODUCT_NAME}"
                       hint="Complete parameter reference" />
        </group>
    </user_interface>
</effect>
```

**Dynamic URL Generation**:
The plugin automatically substitutes variables in button URLs:
- `{PRODUCT_ID}`: Unique identifier for the specific effect
- `{PRODUCT_NAME}`: Human-readable effect name
- `{MACHINE_ID}`: Current machine's hardware fingerprint
- `{VERSION}`: Plugin version for support purposes

This approach enables web pages to be pre-populated with relevant user information, reducing friction in license management and support workflows.

### Internet Connectivity Architecture

**Cross-Platform Browser Integration**:
Opening URLs from OFX plugins requires platform-specific implementations:

**Windows Implementation**:
- `ShellExecute()` Windows API for URL opening
- Registry verification for default browser
- Firewall and security permission considerations

**macOS Implementation**:
- `NSWorkspace` Cocoa framework for URL handling
- LaunchServices for default application resolution
- Sandboxing compatibility for App Store distributed hosts

**Linux Implementation**:
- `xdg-open` command for desktop environment integration
- Fallback mechanisms for different window managers
- Environment variable detection for display sessions

**OFX Host Integration**:
Different OFX hosts may provide their own URL opening mechanisms. The implementation includes fallback strategies:
1. Host-provided URL opening (preferred)
2. Platform-specific system calls
3. Command execution with platform detection
4. Manual URL copying as last resort

**Network Environment Considerations**:
Professional video facilities often have restricted network access. The system accounts for:
- Corporate firewall policies
- Proxy server configurations
- VPN-only internet access
- Air-gapped systems (offline licensing validation)

## License Lifecycle Management

### Initial Purchase and Installation

**User Purchase Flow**:
1. User discovers plugin through marketing or word-of-mouth
2. Downloads and installs OFX plugin (includes trial functionality)
3. Plugin operates in trial mode with watermark for evaluation period
4. User clicks "Renew License" button when ready to purchase
5. Browser opens to purchase page with machine ID pre-filled
6. After payment, user receives license file via email
7. User places license file in designated plugin directory
8. Plugin detects license file and removes watermark on next startup

**Technical Implementation**:
The purchase page captures the user's machine ID and generates a license file containing:
```
product_id=premium_blur_v1
machine_fingerprint=a1b2c3d4e5f6789...
purchase_date=2024-06-01
expiration_date=2025-06-01
license_type=annual
signature=cryptographic_hash_of_above_data
```

### Trial Period Management

**Time-Based Trial System**:
New installations automatically enter a 14-day trial period. The trial system:
- Tracks first usage date in local plugin preferences
- Provides full functionality during trial period
- Displays watermark and renewal prompts after expiration
- Cannot be reset by reinstalling (tied to machine fingerprint)

**Trial User Experience**:
During the trial period, users experience:
- Full plugin functionality to evaluate quality
- Subtle watermark indicating trial status
- Clear messaging about remaining trial time
- Easy access to purchase workflow through UI buttons

### License Transfer Mechanism

**Transfer Initiation**:
When users need to move their license to a new machine, they:
1. Click "Transfer License" button on current machine
2. Browser opens to transfer page with current machine ID
3. User confirms transfer request and receives transfer token
4. License becomes invalid on current machine
5. User installs plugin on new machine and enters transfer token
6. New license file is generated for new machine

**Technical Transfer Process**:
The transfer system maintains a simple database mapping:
- Original purchase email and payment reference
- Current active machine fingerprint
- Temporary transfer tokens (24-hour expiration)
- Transfer history for support purposes

**Security Considerations**:
- Transfer can only be initiated from currently licensed machine
- Transfer tokens are single-use and time-limited
- Transfer history is logged for fraud detection
- Maximum one active machine per license at any time

### Annual Renewal Process

**Renewal Workflow**:
As license expiration approaches:
1. Plugin displays renewal reminders starting 30 days before expiration
2. User clicks "Renew License" button
3. Browser opens to renewal page with current license information
4. User completes payment for additional year
5. New license file extends expiration date
6. Updated license file is delivered via email

**Renewal Benefits**:
- Pricing continuity (no price increases for existing customers)
- Seamless transition (no interruption in functionality)
- License history preservation for support purposes
- Option to upgrade to premium tiers during renewal

## Web Backend Architecture

### Static Website Approach

**Infrastructure Simplicity**:
The web backend is designed as a collection of static web pages and simple server-side scripts, minimizing hosting complexity and maintenance overhead. This approach provides:
- High reliability with minimal moving parts
- Low hosting costs suitable for bootstrap business model
- Easy deployment and maintenance
- Scalability through content delivery networks

**Core Web Components**:

**License Status Page**: Displays current license information, expiration date, and renewal options
**Purchase/Renewal Page**: Payment processing integration with license file generation
**Transfer Management**: Secure license transfer workflow with token generation
**Support Portal**: Pre-filled support forms with machine and license information
**Tutorial Library**: Organized video tutorials and documentation for each plugin

### Database Requirements

**Minimal Data Storage**:
The system requires only basic license tracking:
```sql
licenses (
    license_id: unique identifier
    product_id: which plugin was purchased
    customer_email: for communication and support
    purchase_date: for renewal timing
    expiration_date: for license validation
    machine_fingerprint: currently authorized machine
    transfer_token: temporary token for license moves
    status: active/transferred/expired
)
```

**Privacy Considerations**:
- No personal information beyond email address
- No usage tracking or analytics
- Machine fingerprints are anonymized hashes
- Minimal data retention (only active licenses)
